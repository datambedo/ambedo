$$
\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=L
$$

$$
(\forall \epsilon > 0) (\exists \delta > 0) (\forall x \in \Re) (0 < |x-c| < \delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon)
$$
$f(x)$ is near $L$ , when $x$ is _suitably near c_.

**Proofs seem to be mostly algebra tricks :(**

Proofs
1. Goal is to pick a $\delta$ in terms of $\epsilon$ , and write $f(x)-L$ in terms of $x-c$ 
2. Then you can do algebra to show $f(x)-L$ is less than some modification of $\delta$ 
3. Then substitute $\epsilon$ for $\delta$ 
4. To show the function error from limit is less than $\epsilon$
